# OmegaPiPi Final State

## Process:
gamma p->pi^+pi^-pi^+pi^-pi^0 p



## Event selections:

### At initialization:
Time of flight of pi+ and pi- in SYS_TOF, |delta_t| < 2 ns
kinematic fit cut: DCutAction_KinFitFOM(dComboWrapper, 1e-5)

### Looping over combos:
Accidental subtraction 
Beam energy > 8 GeV
Missing mass squared < 0.04 GeV
|M(pi+pi-pi0)-M(omega)| < 0.05 GeV
